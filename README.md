Register: You can register as a dog walker or pet owner - In order to relate the dog walker with pet owners please register the same company code on registration page to link them together. The clients that are registered with same code as walker will display proper schedule & client relation in list. 

Payment: In order to test apple pay you will need to test on a simulator. It will work on a device but you will need to have a sandbox tester account created with a test card from my apple developer account.

Fixes: Need to change the payment alerts to push notifications.

Future Release: All alerts for payments and schedules will be push notifications in the final build of my application. Also displaying sectioned schedules depending on the status of their walk will show upcoming, completed/please pay, & paid so that all users have a log of their current, upcoming, and previous walks will also be present in the final build of my application. I have ran into code signing issue working with apple pay and push notifcations, I have apple developer support helping to fix my code sigining error when I am making a certificate.
