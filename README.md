Register: You can register as a dog walker or pet owner - In order to relate the dog walker with pet owners please register the same company code on registration to link them together. The clients that are registered with same code as walker will display proper schedule & client relation in list. 

Bugs: When walk is completed and then the client pays for the walk the alert presents again that walk has been completed.

Fixes: Need to change the paid flags to push notifications instead of alert to fix walk completed bug.
